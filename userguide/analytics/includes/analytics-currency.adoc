Each table containing monetary columns (e.g. price, mrr, ...) will also contain a currency column, expressing the currency of the monetary values. This can be difficult to work with as tables can contain rows in various currencies: any arithmetic across them won't make any sense.

To work around this problem, the Analytics plugin has the concept of converted currency, which is a global constant currency of reference. Each monetary column will have a column associated to it with the converted value in this currency.

By default, converted values are all *NULL*. To enable this feature, you need to populate the *analytics_currency_conversion* table to contain the rates you'd like to use for various currencies, for a given period of time. For example, you may choose to populate the new rates at the beginning of each month.

By default, the reference currency is USD, but you can change it via:

[source,bash]
----
org.killbill.billing.plugin.analytics.referenceCurrency=EUR
