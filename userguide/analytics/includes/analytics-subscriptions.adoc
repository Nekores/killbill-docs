The table *analytics_subscriptions* maintains information about Kill Bill subscriptions. It describes the history of changes (both past and future) on a per subscription basis.

*analytics_subscriptions* will contain all phase transitions for all subscriptions and can be used to build subscription timelines. A few remarks:

* Given a subscription id, events are sorted chronologically when stored (you can rely on record_id asc)
* *prev_* fields will always be NULL for creation events
* *next_* fields will always be NULL for cancellation events
* A CHANGE event corresponds to a user initiated change (e.g. upgrade) whereas SYSTEM_CHANGE corresponds to a phase event (e.g. transition from trial to evergreen phase)
* The *requested_timestamp* field reflects when the transition was requested, the *next_start_date* field reflects the effective transition time
